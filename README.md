## TODO: remove public read access

AWS bucket policy is `public read` until [the issue in Camaleon CMS will get solved](https://github.
com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/issues/955)

Current bucket policy:

## Testing and profiling

The `derailed_benchmarks` gem is running performance test in `production` environment, so the `production` DB in the `config/database.yml` is pointing to the development DB.

The following specs could be run:

### Static memory reports:

```bash
bundle exec derailed bundle:mem # Memory used at Require time

bundle exec derailed bundle:mem development # Memory used at Require time in `development` environment

bundle exec derailed bundle:objects # Objects created at Require time

bundle exec derailed bundle:objects development # Objects created at Require time in `development` environment

```

### Dynamic profiling

```bash
$ bundle exec derailed exec --help
  $ derailed exec perf:allocated_objects  # outputs allocated object diff after app is called TEST_COUNT times
  $ derailed exec perf:app  # runs the performance test against two most recent commits of the current app
  $ derailed exec perf:gc  # outputs GC::Profiler.report data while app is called TEST_COUNT times
  $ derailed exec perf:heap  # heap analyzer
  $ derailed exec perf:ips  # iterations per second
  $ derailed exec perf:library  # runs the same test against two different branches for statistical comparison
  $ derailed exec perf:mem  # show memory usage caused by invoking require per gem
  $ derailed exec perf:mem_over_time  # outputs memory usage over time
  $ derailed exec perf:objects  # profiles ruby allocation
  $ derailed exec perf:stackprof  # stackprof
  $ derailed exec perf:test  # hits the url TEST_COUNT times
  $ derailed exec perf:heap_diff  # three heaps generation for comparison
```
