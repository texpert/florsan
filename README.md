# README

* Ruby version: 3.3.5

* Rails version: 7.2.1.2

* Node JS version: 20.16.0

* System dependencies

* Configuration

> ### ðŸ’¡ Note: Multi environment credentials

To edit the credentials file, run `EDITOR="nano" rails credentials:edit`. This command will create the credentials file
the `config/master.key` if there is no such file, and, also, the `config/credentials.yml.enc`if it does not exist. 

The `master.key` should be provisioned to the Rails app as the `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` environment variable by the hosting 
platform (Heroku).

Other credentials, including the `secret_key_base`, are typically stored in the encrypted files  per environment in the 
`config/credentials` folder. These encrypted files could be edited, running in the terminal the following command:

```shell
$ EDITOR="nano" rails credentials:edit --environment=development
```

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions: `git push heroku main` or `git push heroku branchname:main`

## TODO: remove public read access

AWS bucket policy is `public read` until [the issue in Camaleon CMS will get solved](https://github.
com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/issues/955)

Current bucket policy:

## Testing and profiling

The `derailed_benchmarks` gem is running performance test in `production` environment, so the `production` DB in the `config/database.yml` is pointing to the development DB.

The following specs could be run:

### Static memory reports:

```bash
bundle exec derailed bundle:mem # Memory used at Require time

bundle exec derailed bundle:mem development # Memory used at Require time in `development` environment

bundle exec derailed bundle:objects # Objects created at Require time

bundle exec derailed bundle:objects development # Objects created at Require time in `development` environment

```

### Dynamic profiling

```bash
$ bundle exec derailed exec --help
  $ derailed exec perf:allocated_objects  # outputs allocated object diff after app is called TEST_COUNT times
  $ derailed exec perf:app  # runs the performance test against two most recent commits of the current app
  $ derailed exec perf:gc  # outputs GC::Profiler.report data while app is called TEST_COUNT times
  $ derailed exec perf:heap  # heap analyzer
  $ derailed exec perf:ips  # iterations per second
  $ derailed exec perf:library  # runs the same test against two different branches for statistical comparison
  $ derailed exec perf:mem  # show memory usage caused by invoking require per gem
  $ derailed exec perf:mem_over_time  # outputs memory usage over time
  $ derailed exec perf:objects  # profiles ruby allocation
  $ derailed exec perf:stackprof  # stackprof
  $ derailed exec perf:test  # hits the url TEST_COUNT times
  $ derailed exec perf:heap_diff  # three heaps generation for comparison
```

### ESLint

Run the following command:

```bash
yarn eslint
```

### Stylelint

Run the following command:

```bash
yarn stylelint "**/*.{css,js,scss}"
```
